# Vector Mathematics

This is a repository of template functions that operate on Boost vectors. These were developed to speed up the conversion of code written in scientific programming languages (Python, MATLAB) into C++.

## Operations

* FFT
  * handled by the `kiss_fft` library
* Exponentiation
* Complex valued vectors
* Polynomial evaluation
